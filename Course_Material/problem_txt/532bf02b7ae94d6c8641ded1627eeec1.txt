True or False? The internal computer representation of any number is always an approximation. 

        

          

            

              

                
True

The decimal 11 is what binary?:

        

          

            

              

                
11

              

                
1011

              

                
1101

              

                
cannot be converted
True or False? The internal representation of the decimal number 1/10 = 0.1 requires an infinite number of digits.

        

          

            

              

                
True

              

                
False
After many computations, you get two floating numbers stored in variables 
a
b
a == b

        

          

            

              

                
Doing the comparison will always lead to a correct program.

              

                
Doing the comparison will sometimes lead to a correct program.

              

                
Doing the comparison will never lead to a correct program.

    
1. Some numbers, like integers, can be represented exactly.
3. Look back at the last slide in the video. "If there is no integer p such that a power of 2
multiplied by x gives me a whole number, then the best I'm going to get is an internal representation that's close." That is the case for this example. 
4. When you do many computations on floats, you accumulate floating point errors. The errors accumulated for 
a
b

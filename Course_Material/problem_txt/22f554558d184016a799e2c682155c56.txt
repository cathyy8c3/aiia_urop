Here is some code:

      
Code Sample
iteration = 0
count = 0
while iteration < 5:
    for letter in "hello, world":
        count += 1
    print("Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count))
    iteration += 1 
We wish to re-write the above code, but instead of nesting a

	Sample
Try to answer the following questions by just reading the code.
      Reading code is a very good skill to have (and will help you both
      in your programming career and on your exams!). It is okay to
      check your answers that you obtain from just reading the code, then 
      in your interpreter run the code for the ones you got wrong on your
      first attempt. 

      
Test 1
for iteration in range(5):
    count = 0
    while True:
        for letter in "hello, world":
            count += 1
        print("Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count))

      

        

          

            

              
Yes, Test 1 gives the same output as the Code Sample

            

              
No, Test 1 does not give the same output as the Code Sample

      
Test 2
for iteration in range(5):
    count = 0
    while True:
        for letter in "hello, world":
            count += 1
        print("Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count))
        break

      

        

          

            

              
Yes, Test 2 gives the same output as the Code Sample

            

              
No, Test 2 does not give the same output as the Code Sample

      
Test 3
count = 0
phrase = "hello, world"
for iteration in range(5):
    index = 0
    while index < len(phrase):
        count += 1
        index += 1
    print("Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count))

      

        

          

            

              
Yes, Test 3 gives the same output as the Code Sample

            

              
No, Test 3 does not give the same output as the Code Sample

      
Test 4
count = 0
phrase = "hello, world"
for iteration in range(5):
    while True:
        count += len(phrase)
        break
    print("Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count))

      

        

          

            

              
Yes, Test 4 gives the same output as the Code Sample

            

              
No, Test 4 does not give the same output as the Code Sample

      
Test 5
count = 0
phrase = "hello, world"
for iteration in range(5):
    count += len(phrase)
    print("Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count))

      

        

          

            

              
Yes, Test 5 gives the same output as the Code Sample

            

              
No, Test 5 does not give the same output as the Code Sample

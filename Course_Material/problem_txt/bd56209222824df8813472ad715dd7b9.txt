  
Consider the following two functions and select the correct choice below: 
def foo_one(n):
    """ Assume n is an int >= 0 """
    answer = 1.0
    while n > 1:
        answer *= n
        n -= 1
    return answer

def foo_two(n):
    """ Assume n is an int >= 0 """
    if n <= 1: 
        return 1.0
    else: 
        return n*foo_two(n-1)

    

      
The worst case Big Oh time complexity of 
foo_one
foo_two
The worst case Big Oh time complexity of 
foo_two
foo_one
The worst case Big Oh time complexity of 
foo_one
foo_two
Impossible to compare the worst case Big Oh time complexities of the two functions.

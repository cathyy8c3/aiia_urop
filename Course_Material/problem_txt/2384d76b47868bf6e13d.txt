gcd
One way is recursively, where the greatest common denominator of 
a
b
gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b)

      For example, the greatest common divisor (gcd) between 
a = 20
b = 12
gcd(20,12)
gcd(12, 20 mod 12)	= gcd(12,8)
gcd(12,8)
gcd(8, 12 mod 8)		= gcd(8,4)
gcd(8,4)
gcd(4, 8 mod 4) 		= gcd(4,0)
a
b
def gcd(a, b):
    """
    a, b: two positive integers
    Returns the greatest common divisor of a and b
    """

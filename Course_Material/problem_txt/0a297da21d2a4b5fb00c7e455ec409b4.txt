      give the computer the option to play.
      Write the code that re-implements the

Hints about the output

          
Be sure to inspect the above sample output carefully - very little is actually printed out 
	in this function specifically. Most of the printed output actually comes from the code you wrote
	in 
playHand
compPlayHand
You should also make calls to the 
dealHand
Here is the above output, with the output from 
playHand
compPlayHand

Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: r
You have not played a hand yet. Please play a new hand first!
            
Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: n

Enter u to have yourself play, c to have the computer play: u

<call to playHand> 

Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: r

Enter u to have yourself play, c to have the computer play: c

<call to compPlayHand> 

Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: x
Invalid command.

Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: n

Enter u to have yourself play, c to have the computer play: me
Invalid command.

Enter u to have yourself play, c to have the computer play: you
Invalid command.

Enter u to have yourself play, c to have the computer play: c

<call to compPlayHand> 

Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: n

Enter u to have yourself play, c to have the computer play: u

<call to playHand> 

Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: r

Enter u to have yourself play, c to have the computer play: c

<call to compPlayHand> 

Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: e

Hopefully this hint makes the problem seem a bit more approachable.

        

          
A Note On Runtime

          
You may notice that things run slowly when the
      computer plays. This is to be expected. If you want
      (totally optional!), feel free to investigate ways of
      making the computer's turn go faster - one way is to
      preprocess the word list into a dictionary (string ->
      int) so looking up the score of a word becomes much faster
      in the 
compChooseWord
Be careful though - you only want to do this preprocessing 
one
        time
IMPORTANT:
much

        

          
Entering Your Code

          
Be sure to only paste your definition for 
playGame
ps4b.py

    

      

def playGame(wordList):
    """
    Allow the user to play an arbitrary number of hands.
 
    1) Asks the user to input 'n' or 'r' or 'e'.
        * If the user inputs 'e', immediately exit the game.
        * If the user inputs anything that's not 'n', 'r', or 'e', keep asking them again.

    2) Asks the user to input a 'u' or a 'c'.
        * If the user inputs anything that's not 'c' or 'u', keep asking them again.

    3) Switch functionality based on the above choices:
        * If the user inputted 'n', play a new (random) hand.
        * Else, if the user inputted 'r', play the last hand again.
          But if no hand was played, output "You have not played a hand yet. 
          Please play a new hand first!"
        
        * If the user inputted 'u', let the user play the game
          with the selected hand, using playHand.
        * If the user inputted 'c', let the computer play the 
          game with the selected hand, using compPlayHand.

    4) After the computer or user has played the hand, repeat from step 1

    wordList: list (string)

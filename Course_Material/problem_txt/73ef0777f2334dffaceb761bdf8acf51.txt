  
The next video and exercise introduce your first algorithm. It forces you to think in a different way, and we'd like students to answer the following questions proir to watching the video and doing the finger exercises. This is not for points, just a personal checkpoint. You will be asked these same questions after the material, to see if you understood the concepts.
You only get to submit once, so please choose carefully.

Fill in the blank. To solve the equation f(x) = 0, where f is a continuous function, we define an interval [a, b] where f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs. We say that f must have at least one _______ in the interval (a, b) by the intermediate value theorem. ?  

    
value
variable
root
integer
constant

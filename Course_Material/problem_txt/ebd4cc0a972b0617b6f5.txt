aList
aList = ["apple", "cat",
      "dog", "banana"]
["cat", "dog"]
This function takes in a list of strings and returns a list of strings. Your function should not modify 
aList
def lessThan4(aList):
    '''
    aList: a list of strings
    '''
    # Your code here
    

    

      
# Paste your function here

def lessThan4(aList):
    shortStrings = []
    for i in aList:
        if len(i) < 4:
            shortStrings.append(i)
    return shortStrings

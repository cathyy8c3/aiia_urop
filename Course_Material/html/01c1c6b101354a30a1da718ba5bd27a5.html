<p><strong>OPTIONAL EXERCISE - NOT GRADED (you must have access to Google to participate)</strong></p>
<p>Programming can be considered a creative process. You may not always get the right answer immediately and this should not discourage you to keep trying. Programmer's block (like writer's block) happens to everyone. And sometimes, an idea pops into your mind while doing something else!</p>
<p>So, we are providing you with this drawing area. Everyone in the course can collaborate on this drawing. Take a break, doodle here, and create something wonderful! Who knows, your "aha" moment may happen anytime!&nbsp;</p>

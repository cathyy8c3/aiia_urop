For example, if 
s = "This is great!"
print_without_vowels
Ths s grt!
s = "a"
print_without_vowels
def print_without_vowels(s):
    '''
    s: the string to convert
    Finds a version of s without vowels and whose characters appear in the 
    same order they appear in s. Prints this version of s.
    Does not return anything
    '''
    # Your code here

    

      
# Paste your function here

The "None" in each test case comes from the function call being printed. Your function does not return anything, only prints a string as described above.

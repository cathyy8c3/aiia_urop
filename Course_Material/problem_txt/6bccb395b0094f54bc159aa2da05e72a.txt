      Note that you will have to answer all questions before you can click the Check button.
For each of the following expressions, indicate the value returned, 
      or if the evaluation would lead to an error, write the word 'error' 
      (note this is a word, not a string, no quotes). While you could simply type 
      these expressions into your IDE, we encourage you to answer 
      them directly since this will help reinforce your understanding of 
      basic Python expressions.

Remember that in Python words are case-sensitive. The word

Hint: Priority order of Boolean operations

            
For these problems, it's important to understand the priority of 
	      Boolean operations. The order of operations is as follows: 

              

                
Parentheses. Before operating on anything else, 
		  Python must evaluate all parentheticals starting at the innermost level. 

                
not

                
and

                
or
What this means is that an expression like 

not True and False

evaluates to 
False
not
not True
False
and
False and False
False
However the expression 

not (True and False)

evaluates to 
True
True and False
False
not
not False
True
Overall, you should always use parenthesis when writing expressions to make it clear what order 
	      you wish to have Python evaluate your expression. As we've seen here, 
not (True and False)
(not True) and False
not True and False

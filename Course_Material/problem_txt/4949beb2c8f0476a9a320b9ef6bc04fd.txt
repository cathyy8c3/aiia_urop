In this problem you'll be given a chance to practice writing some while loops.
1. Convert the following into code that uses a while loop.
prints 
2
4
6
8
10
Goodbye!

    

      

# There are many ways to solve this problem! Here is one:
num = 2
while num < 11:
    print(num)
    num += 2
print("Goodbye!")

# Here is another:
num = 2
while num <= 10:
    print(num)
    num += 2
print("Goodbye!")

# And another:
num = 0
while True:
    num += 2
    print(num)
    if num >= 10:
        print("Goodbye!")
        break

# And one more:
num = 1
while num <= 10:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(num)
    num += 1
print("Goodbye!")

# There are always many, many different ways to solve a programming
# problem. Here are just four examples and surely there are quite
# a few more.

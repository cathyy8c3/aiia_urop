n
s

      
The area of a regular polygon is: [mathjaxinline]\frac{0.25*n*s^2}{tan(\pi/n)}[/mathjaxinline]
The perimeter of a polygon is: length of the boundary of the polygon
Write a function called 
polysum
n
s

      

        

          
Hint: What to import?

          
Which library should you be importing at the beginning of your code in order to call the 
tan
This is an optional exercise, but great for extra practice!

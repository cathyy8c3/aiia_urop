Now that you have completed your word game code, you decide that
      you would like to enable your computer (SkyNet) to play the game 
      (your hidden agenda is to prove once and for all
      that computers are inferior to human intellect!) In Part B
      you will make a modification to the 
playHand
It is your responsibility to create the function
        
compChooseWord(hand, wordList, n)
ps4b.py
If you follow the pseudocode,
      you'll create a computer player that is legal, but not
      always the best. Once you've implemented it following our approach,
      feel free to try your own approach! As much as we'd love to give you
      credit for making an improved

A Note On Runtime

          
You may notice that things run a bit slowly when the
      computer plays. This is to be expected - the 
wordList
However, don't worry about this issue when running
    your code in the checker below! We load a very small sample wordList 
    (

Test Cases

          
Some test cases to look at:
>>> compChooseWord({'a': 1, 'p': 2, 's': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 1}, wordList, 6)
appels
>>> compChooseWord({'a': 2, 'c': 1, 'b': 1, 't': 1}, wordList, 5)
acta
>>> compChooseWord({'a': 2, 'e': 2, 'i': 2, 'm': 2, 'n': 2, 't': 2}, wordList, 12)
immanent
>>> compChooseWord({'x': 2, 'z': 2, 'q': 2, 'n': 2, 't': 2}, wordList, 12)
None
For the first test case your code might also find 
apples

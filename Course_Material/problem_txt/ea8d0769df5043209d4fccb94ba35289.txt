Although Python provides a built-in function for computing the length of a string, 
      we can write our own. 
Write an iterative function, 
lenIter

    

      

def lenIter(aStr):
    '''
    aStr: a string
    
    returns: int, the length of aStr
    '''
    # Your code here


def lenIter(aStr):
    '''
    aStr: a string
    
    returns: int, the length of aStr
    '''
    # Initialize a variable to hold our final count
    count = 0

    # Iterate over each character in the string, counting each one
    for char in aStr:
        count += 1
    return count

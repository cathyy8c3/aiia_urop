<p>The problem set units you find here are duplicates of the problem sets you hand in. Here's how it works:</p>
<p>After a problem set deadline has passed, the Sandbox will update to contain that particular problem set. You can continue entering your code so that you may check it with our grader.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;" data-mce-mark="1">You can submit as many times as you want. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;" data-mce-mark="1">You can still see whether your code is Correct or Incorrect. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;" data-mce-mark="1">You can still see which test cases your code passed or failed when compared with the grader's code. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">The code you enter here <strong>does not count towards your grade</strong>. It is merely here as an extra tool for you to play around with.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">Have fun in the sandbox!</span></p>

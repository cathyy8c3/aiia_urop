      is possible, for example, to buy exactly 15 McNuggets (with one package of 6 and a
      second package of 9), but it is not possible to buy exactly 16 McNuggets, since no non-
      negative integer combination of 6's, 9's and 20's add up to 16. To determine if it is
      possible to buy exactly

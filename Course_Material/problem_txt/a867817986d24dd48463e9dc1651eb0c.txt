For the following programs, fill in the best-case and the worst-case
      number of steps it will take to run each program.
For these questions, you'll be asked to write a mathematical expression.
      Use +, -, / signs to indicate addition, subtraction, and division. Explicitly
      indicate multiplication with a * (ie say "6*n" rather than "6n").
      Indicate exponentiation with a caret (^) (ie "n^4" for [mathjaxinline]n^4[/mathjaxinline]).
      Indicate base-2 logarithms with the word log2 followed by parenthesis (ie "log2(n)").

      

        
Program 1:
def program1(L):
    multiples = []
    for x in L:
        for y in L:
            multiples.append(x*y)
    return multiples
What is the number of steps it will take to run Program 1
	in the best case? Express your answer in terms of 
n

Explanation:
In the best case scenario, 
L
for x in L
In the worst case scenario,

for y in L
The inner loop has three operations (assignment of a value to y, x*y, and list appending). 
		So the inner loop executes 3*n times on 
each iteration
Adding in two steps (for the first assignment statement, and the return statement)
		we see that in the worst case, this program executes 3*n**2 + n + 2 steps.

        
Program 2:
def program2(L):
    squares = []
    for x in L:
        for y in L:
            if x == y:
                squares.append(x*y)
    return squares

In the last video, Professor Grimson introduced the idea of "asymptotic complexity", which
	  means we describe running time in terms of number of basic steps. We've described the best- and
	  worst-case running times in terms number of basic steps for the three programs above. Now,
	  we'd like you to give the complexity order (ie, "Big O" running time) of each of the above programs.
Recall that "Big O" notation gives an upper bound on asymptotic growth of a function. So, should
	  you use the best-case or the worst-case running times for each program? Review the video again 
	  if you're unsure of what to put for the following boxes.
Note: Your answer should be expressed with a capital letter O, then a mathematical term similar to
	  one described in the introduction to this problem - for example, O(n^5).

What is the complexity order of Program 3? 

              

                

          

            

              

                
Explanation:
Remember the following rules when determining the complexity order of a function:

                

                  
If running time is a sum of multiple terms, keep one with the largest growth rate (so n**3 
		    + 100n**2 + 500,000 is O(n**3)).

                  
If the remaining term is a product (eg 3n**2), drop any multiplicative constants (so 3n**2 is O(n**2)).
 It's also good to note that if you have a function that takes a constant number of steps - regardless 
		of the size of the input - the function is O(1), even if it takes 3,000,000 steps every time! This is
		because the function does not take any additional time as the input grows large.
Finally, pay attention to the fact that Programs 1, 2, and 3 were all O(n**2). This is important!
		Generally, a nested loop structure has O(n**2) complexity. This is not the best, as we'll discover
		in the next lectures in this sequence.

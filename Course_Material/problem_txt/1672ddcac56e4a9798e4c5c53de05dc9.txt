Determine the complexity of the following tasks.

      

        
6.00.1x staff decide to hold an online chess tournament, and 
n
n

[mathjaxinline]O(\log n)[/mathjaxinline] 

                

                  
[mathjaxinline]O(n\log n)[/mathjaxinline]

                

                  
It depends on how the tournament is organized.

          

            

              

                
Explanation:
To win, a student will have to play every student on their side and keep winning, eliminating students one at a time, a total of n/2 students.

Explanation:
Each page takes 30 mins to write and there are n pages. The total time is

[mathjaxinline]O(n\log n)[/mathjaxinline]

          

            

              

                
Explanation:
The number of pages you write does not influence how long it takes you to write. The time to write is a constant 2 hours, so order of 1.

        
You just dropped a box of glass toys and 
n
n

[mathjaxinline]O(n\log n)[/mathjaxinline]

            

              

                

                  
Explanation:
You have to compare every piece with every other piece. If you have 1 toy and it breaks in half, you have 1 comparison to make. If you have 2 toys and they both break in half there are 4 pieces and you have to do 6 comparisons. If you have 3 toys, there are 6 pieces and you have to do 15 comparisons. If you have 
N/2
N
N-1 + N-2 + N-3 + ... + 1 =(N)(N-1)/2
O(N^2)

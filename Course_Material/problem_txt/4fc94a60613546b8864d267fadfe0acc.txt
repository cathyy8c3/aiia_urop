Consider the following code: 
x = 25
epsilon = 0.01
step = 0.1
guess = 0.0

while guess <= x:
    if abs(guess**2 -x) < epsilon:
        break
    else:
        guess += step

if abs(guess**2 - x) >= epsilon:
    print('failed')
else:
    print('succeeded: ' + str(guess))

If this code is executed, it will print 
succeeded: 4.9999999999998
succeeded: 5.0

Now suppose we try the following: 
x = 25
epsilon = 0.01
step = 0.1
guess = 0.0

while guess <= x:
    if abs(guess**2 -x) >= epsilon:
        guess += step

if abs(guess**2 - x) >= epsilon:
    print('failed')
else:
    print('succeeded: ' + str(guess))

Finally, let's use the same code as immediately above, but change the first line to 
x = 23

The purpose is not to give you the \"correct\" code, but rather to guide you with some hints to get to the answer(s) yourself. I'll be taking some questions and then mainly sharing my screen and interacting with participants that way.

If you don't have that software installed already, you will be prompted to download and install. It's the most stable video system I've used so far but you will need a good Internet connection to participate. The software is available on Mac, PC, and Linux as well as Android and iOS.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that I will be recording this so (1) if you can't attend, perhaps you can watch the recording and (2) by participating, you agree to be recorded (voice, video, screen, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if something goes technically very wrong during the meeting, or if you cannot connect properly, please remember this is an experiment and we can't guarantee anything.</p>\n\n<p>See you soon,<br/>\nThomas Ballatore</p>\n\n</p>\n\n<hr/>\n<p><b>New lectures are already out!</b> </p>\n\n<p>This week, we will look at new data types: lists and dictionaries.

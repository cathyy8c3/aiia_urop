    <p>
      Write a Python function, <code>twoQuadratics</code>, that takes in two sets of coefficients
and x-values and prints the sum of the results of evaluating two quadratic
equations. It does not do anything else. That is, you should evaluate and print the result of the following equation:
      [mathjaxinline]a_1*x_1^2 + b_1*x_1 + c_1 + a_2*x_2^2 + b_2*x_2 + c_2[/mathjaxinline]</p>
    <p>You are given the following function, <code>evalQuadratic</code></p>
    <pre>def evalQuadratic(a, b, c, x):
   '''
   a, b, c: numerical values for the coefficients of a quadratic equation
   x: numerical value at which to evaluate the quadratic.
   '''
   return a*x*x + b*x + c
    </pre>
    <p>Use the given function (you don't need to redefine <code>evalQuadratic</code> in this box; when you call <code>evalQuadratic</code>, our definition will be used).</p>
    
    <pre>def twoQuadratics(a1, b1, c1, x1, a2, b2, c2, x2):
    '''
    a1, b1, c1: one set of coefficients of a quadratic equation
    a2, b2, c2: another set of coefficients of a quadratic equation
    x1, x2: values at which to evaluate the quadratics

Here is code for linear search that uses the fact that a set of elements is sorted in increasing order: 
def search(L, e):
    for i in range(len(L)):
        if L[i] == e:
            return True
        if L[i] > e:
            return False
    return False
 
    

Consider the following code, which is an alternative version of 
search
def newsearch(L, e):
    size = len(L)
    for i in range(size):
        if L[size-i-1] == e:
            return True
        if L[i] < e:
            return False
    return False

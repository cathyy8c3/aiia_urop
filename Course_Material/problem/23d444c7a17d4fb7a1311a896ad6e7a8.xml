    <p>In this problem, you'll create a program that guesses a secret number!</p>
    <p>The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). The 
      computer makes guesses, and you give it 
      input - is its guess too high or too low? Using bisection search, the computer will guess 
      the user's secret number!</p>
    <p>Here is a transcript of an example session:</p>
    <pre>Please think of a number between 0 and 100!
Is your secret number 50?
Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. l
Is your secret number 75?
Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. l
Is your secret number 87?
Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. h
Is your secret number 81?
Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. l
Is your secret number 84?
Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. h
Is your secret number 82?
Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. l
Is your secret number 83?
Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. c
Game over. Your secret number was: 83

          <p>** Your program should use bisection search. So think carefully what that means.
              What will the first guess always be? How should you calculate subsequent guesses? </p>
          <p>** Your initial endpoints should be 0 and 100. Do not optimize your subsequent endpoints by making them be the halfway point plus or minus 1. Rather, just make them be the halfway point. </p>

# The output will have each string on a separate line:

there
                
# Now try adding the following:
print("Hi",end='')
print("there")
print("Hi",end='*')
print("there")

    <p><b>Note:</b> your program should use <code>input</code> to obtain
    the user's input! Be sure to handle the case when the user's input is not
    one of <code>h</code>, <code>l</code>, or <code>c</code>.</p>
    <p>When the user enters something invalid, you should print out a message to the user explaining you 
    did not understand their input. Then, you should re-ask the question, and prompt again for input. For example:</p>
    <pre>Is your secret number 91?

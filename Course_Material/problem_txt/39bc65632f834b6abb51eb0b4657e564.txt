      to set up a function to allow the computer to play a hand - in a manner
      very similar to Part A's 
playHand
Implement the 
compPlayHand
Be sure to test your function on some randomly generated hands using 
dealHand

Test Cases

          
Some test cases to look at. Note it is okay if your code finds a
    different word, as long as the point values are the same.
compPlayHand({'a': 1, 'p': 2, 's': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 1}, wordList, 6)
Current Hand: a p p s e l
"appels" earned 110 points. Total: 110 points
Total score: 110 points.
compPlayHand({'a': 2, 'c': 1, 'b': 1, 't': 1}, wordList, 5)
Current Hand: a a c b t
"acta" earned 24 points. Total: 24 points

Current Hand: b
Total score: 24 points.
compPlayHand({'a': 2, 'e': 2, 'i': 2, 'm': 2, 'n': 2, 't': 2}, wordList, 12)
Current Hand: a a e e i i m m n n t t
"immanent" earned 96 points. Total: 96 points

Current Hand: a e t i
"ait" earned 9 points. Total: 105 points

def compPlayHand(hand, wordList, n):
    """
    Allows the computer to play the given hand, following the same procedure
    as playHand, except instead of the user choosing a word, the computer 
    chooses it.

    1) The hand is displayed.
    2) The computer chooses a word.
    3) After every valid word: the word and the score for that word is 
    displayed, the remaining letters in the hand are displayed, and the 
    computer chooses another word.
    4)  The sum of the word scores is displayed when the hand finishes.
    5)  The hand finishes when the computer has exhausted its possible
    choices (i.e. compChooseWord returns None).

    wordList: list (string)
    n: integer (HAND_SIZE; i.e., hand size required for additional points)

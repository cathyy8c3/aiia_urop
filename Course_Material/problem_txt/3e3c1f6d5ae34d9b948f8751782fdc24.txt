For this problem, write a recursive function, 
lenRecur
Hint: 
String slicing

    

      

def lenRecur(aStr):
    '''
    aStr: a string
    
    returns: int, the length of aStr
    '''
    # Your code here


def lenRecur(aStr):
    '''
    aStr: a string
    
    returns: int, the length of aStr
    '''
    # Base case: When aStr is the empty string,
    #  its length is zero.
    if aStr == '':
        return 0

    # Recursive case: If the string is not zero-length, then remove the first
    #  character and the length is 1 + the length of the rest of the string
    return 1 + lenRecur(aStr[1:])

Note: In programming there are many ways to solve a problem. For your code to check correctly 
  here, though, you must write your recursive function such that you make a recursive call 
  directly to the function 
lenRecur
Hint: How would you check if a string is empty without using 
len()
s

  s == '' 

If you are getting the error stating that "Your code should be recursive" when you already make a call to 
lenRecur

The greatest common divisor of two positive integers is the largest integer that divides 
      each of them without remainder. For example, 

      

        
gcd(2, 12) = 2 

        
gcd(6, 12) = 6 

        
gcd(9, 12) = 3 

        
gcd(17, 12) = 1 
Write an iterative function, 
gcdIter(a, b)
a
b

    

      

def gcdIter(a, b):
    '''
    a, b: positive integers
    
    returns: a positive integer, the greatest common divisor of a & b.
    '''
    # Your code here


def gcdIter(a, b):
    '''
    a, b: positive integers
    
    returns: a positive integer, the greatest common divisor of a & b.
    '''
    testValue = min(a, b)

    # Keep looping until testValue divides both a & b evenly
    while a % testValue != 0 or b % testValue != 0:
        testValue -= 1

    return testValue

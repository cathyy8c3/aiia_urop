Write a recursive program, 
semordnilap
This recursive function is not entirely straightforward. There are
  a few things that you need to check the first time you look at the inputs
  that you should not check on subsequent recursive calls: you need to make
  sure that the strings are not single characters, and also you need to be
  sure that the strings are not equal. If you do this check every time you
  call your function, though, this will end up interfering with the recursive
  base case (which we don't want!). 
There's a few 
  different ways you can perform checks on the inputs the first time. The
  first way would be to use 
keyword arguments
global variable
  The third way to perform checks on the inputs the first time you see
  them, but not any subsequent time, is to use a 
wrapper function
The idea of a wrapper function is really important. You'll see more
  wrapper functions later. To introduce 
  you to the idea, we are providing you with the wrapper function;
  your job is to write the recursive function 
semordnilap
def semordnilapWrapper(str1, str2):
    # A single-length string cannot be semordnilap
    if len(str1) == 1 or len(str2) == 1:
        return False

    # Equal strings cannot be semordnilap
    if str1 == str2:
        return False

    return semordnilap(str1, str2)

    if len(str1) != len(str2):
        return False

    if len(str1) == 1:
        return str1 == str2

    # Recursive case: check if the first letter of str1 equals the last letter
    # of str2
    if str1[0] == str2[-1]:
        return semordnilap(str1[1:], str2[:-1])
    else:
        return False

Note: In programming there are many ways to solve a problem. For your code to check correctly 
  here, though, you must write your recursive function such that you make a recursive call 
  directly to the function 
semordnilap

      

        
Hints

          

            
Unequal Strings

            
 What happens when two strings are not of equal length? What can you immediately return? 

          

            
What should your base case be?

            
What happens when the strings are of length 1? 

          

            
What should your recursive case be?

            
Go back to the definition of a semordnilap. What can you say about the first letter of 
str1
str2
If you are getting the error stating that "Your code should be recursive" when you already make a call to 
semordnilap

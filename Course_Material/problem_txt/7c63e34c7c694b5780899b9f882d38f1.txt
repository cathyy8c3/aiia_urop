Implement a function that meets the specifications below.  
def longest_run(L):
    """
    Assumes L is a list of integers containing at least 2 elements.
    Finds the longest run of numbers in L, where the longest run can
    either be monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing. 
    In case of a tie for the longest run, choose the longest run 
    that occurs first.
    Does not modify the list.
    Returns the sum of the longest run.

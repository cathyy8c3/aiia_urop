Below is a transcript of a session with the Python shell. For each expression being evaluated, provide the type and the value that the 
last expression in the transcript returns

Assume that the expressions are evaluated in the order shown - that is, each problem part is evaluated directly after the previous problem part(s). 

      

        

          

>>> a = 3
>>> a == 5.0
>>> a 

            

            

        

          

>>> b = 10
>>> c = b > 9
>>> c

        <b>Explanation:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
      Q3. The recipe in question, by itself, says to start with a guess. But in order to make this guess, we would need to have another recipe for how to guess! Examples of such recipes include to use a fixed number, or a pseudorandom number generator, to give 2 examples.
So by itself, the recipe in question is not sufficient to be made into a real program. This question is indicative of how you should not assume you have more info than what the problem specifies.</p>

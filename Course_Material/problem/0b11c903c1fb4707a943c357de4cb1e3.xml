  <text>
    <p>Write a program to calculate the credit card balance
      after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly
      payment required by the credit card company each month.</p>
    <p>The following variables contain values as described below:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><code>balance</code> - the outstanding balance on the credit card</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>annualInterestRate</code> - annual interest rate as a decimal</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>monthlyPaymentRate</code> - minimum monthly payment rate as a decimal</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>For each month, calculate statements on the monthly
      payment and remaining balance. At the end of 12 months, print out the remaining balance. Be sure to print out no more than two decimal digits of accuracy - so print </p>
    <p>
      <pre>Remaining balance: 813.41</pre>
    </p>
    <p>instead of </p>
    <p>
      <pre>Remaining balance: 813.4141998135 </pre>
    </p>
    <p>So your program only prints out one thing: the remaining balance at the end of the year in the format:</p>
    <p>
      <pre>Remaining balance: 4784.0</pre>
    </p>
    <p>A summary of the required math is found below:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Monthly interest rate</strong>= (Annual interest rate) / 12.0<br/><strong>Minimum monthly payment</strong> = (Minimum monthly payment rate) x (Previous balance)<br/>

	<strong>Monthly unpaid balance</strong> = (Previous balance) - (Minimum monthly payment)<br/>

	<strong>Updated balance each month</strong> = (Monthly unpaid balance) + 
          (Monthly interest rate x Monthly unpaid balance) </p>
    </blockquote>

          <p>To help you get started, here is a rough outline of the stages 
	  you should probably follow in writing your code:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>For each month:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Compute the monthly payment, based on the previous
		  monthâ€™s balance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Update the outstanding balance by removing the payment,
	      then charging interest on the result.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Output the month, the minimum monthly payment and the
	      remaining balance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Keep track of the total amount of paid over all
              the past months so far.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Print out the result statement with the total amount
          paid and the remaining balance.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Use these ideas to guide the creation of your code.</p>

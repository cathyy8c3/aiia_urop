In Problem 1, we computed an exponential by iteratively executing successive multiplications. 
      We can use the same idea, but in a recursive function. 
Write a function 
recurPower(base, exp)
base
This function should take in two values - 
base
exp
**

    

      

def recurPower(base, exp):
    '''
    base: int or float.
    exp: int >= 0
 
    returns: int or float, base^exp
    '''
    # Your code here


def recurPower(base, exp):
    '''
    base: int or float.
    exp: int >= 0

    returns: int or float, base^exp
    '''
    # Base case is when exp = 0
    if exp <= 0:
        return 1

    # Otherwise, exp must be > 0, so return 
    #  base* base^(exp-1). This is the recursive case.
    return base * recurPower(base, exp - 1)

Note: In programming there are many ways to solve a problem. For your code to check correctly 
  here, though, you must write your recursive function such that you make a recursive call 
  directly to the function 
recurPower

      

        
Hints

          

            
What should your base case be?

            
  To figure out what 
base case
exp

              

                

                  

                    
Smallest value of exp?

                    
Recall that 
exp
exp
exp
base

          

            
Thinking about recursion

            
A good way to think about recursion is that recursion is the process of solving a given problem with a smaller instance of the same problem. 
So, how could we express [mathjaxinline]\mathrm{base}^{\mathrm{exp}}[/mathjaxinline] as a smaller instance of an exponential equation? 

              

                

                  

                    
How to break down the equation

                    
 [mathjaxinline]\mathrm{base}^{\mathrm{exp}} = \mathrm{base} \cdot \mathrm{base}^{\mathrm{exp-1}}[/mathjaxinline] 
		    
 To convince yourself this is true, put in real numbers for 
base
exp
If you are getting the error stating that "Your code should be recursive" when you already make a call to 
recurPower

Below are some short Python programs. For each program, answer the associated questions. 

Try to answer the questions without running the code. Check your answers, then run the code for the ones you get wrong. 

      

        
iteration = 0
count = 0
while iteration < 5:
    # the variable 'letter' in the loop stands for every 
    # character, including spaces and commas!
    for letter in "hello, world": 
        count += 1
    print("Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count))
    iteration += 1

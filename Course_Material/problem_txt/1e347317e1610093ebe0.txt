twoQuadratics
You are given the following function, 
evalQuadratic
def evalQuadratic(a, b, c, x):
   '''
   a, b, c: numerical values for the coefficients of a quadratic equation
   x: numerical value at which to evaluate the quadratic.
   '''
   return a*x*x + b*x + c
    
Use the given function (you don't need to redefine 
evalQuadratic
evalQuadratic
def twoQuadratics(a1, b1, c1, x1, a2, b2, c2, x2):
    '''
    a1, b1, c1: one set of coefficients of a quadratic equation
    a2, b2, c2: another set of coefficients of a quadratic equation
    x1, x2: values at which to evaluate the quadratics
    '''
  # Your code here  
If you are getting this problem incorrect, re-read the problem statement carefully.

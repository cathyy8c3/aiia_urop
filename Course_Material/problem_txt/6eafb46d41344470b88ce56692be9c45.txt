Here is the code for a function 
applyToEach

def applyToEach(L, f):
    for i in range(len(L)):
        L[i] = f(L[i])


Assume that 

testList = [1, -4, 8, -9]


For each of the following questions (which you may assume is evaluated independently of the previous questions, so that testList has the value indicated above), provide an expression using 
applyToEach
testList

Example Question: 

>>> print(testList)
[5, -20, 40, -45]


      

        

          

            
Solution to Example Question

            

def timesFive(a):
    return a * 5

applyToEach(testList, timesFive)


  >>> print(testList)
  [1, 4, 8, 9]


    

      

# Your Code Here

applyToEach(testList, abs)

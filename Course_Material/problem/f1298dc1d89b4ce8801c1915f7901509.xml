<problem title="Problem 2: Paying Debt Off In a Year" attempts="30" type="lecture" display_name="Problem 2" markdown="null" max_attempts="30" showanswer="never">
  <text>
    <p>Now write a program that calculates the minimum <b>fixed</b>
        monthly payment needed in order pay off a credit card
        balance within 12 months. By a fixed monthly payment, we mean 
	a single number which does not change each month, but instead
	is a constant amount that will be paid each month.</p>
    <p>In this problem, we will <i>not</i> be dealing with a
        minimum monthly payment rate.</p>
    <p>The following variables contain values as described below:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><code>balance</code> - the outstanding balance on the credit card</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>annualInterestRate</code> - annual interest rate as a decimal</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p> The program should print out one line: the lowest monthly payment that 
      will pay off all debt in under 1 year, for example: </p>
    <p>
      <pre>Lowest Payment: 180 </pre>
    </p>
    <p>Assume that the interest is compounded monthly according
        to the balance at the end of the month (after the
        payment for that month is made). The monthly payment must
        be a multiple of $10 and is the same for all months. Notice
        that it is possible for the balance to become negative
        using this payment scheme, which is okay. A summary of the required math is found below:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Monthly interest rate</strong>
= (Annual interest rate) / 12.0<br/>

	<strong>Monthly unpaid balance</strong> = (Previous balance) - (Minimum fixed monthly payment)<br/>

	<strong>Updated balance each month</strong> = (Monthly unpaid balance) + 
          (Monthly interest rate x Monthly unpaid balance) </p>
    </blockquote>

	    and try again (using the same code!) to compute the balance at the

		A good way to implement this problem will be to use a loop structure. You may want to refresh your
		understanding of <b>while</b> loops. Think hard about how the program will know when it has found 
		a good minimum monthly payment value - when a good value is found, the loop can terminate.

            <li>Be careful - you don't want to overwrite the original value of <code>balance</code>. You'll need to save that
	value somehow for later reference!</li>

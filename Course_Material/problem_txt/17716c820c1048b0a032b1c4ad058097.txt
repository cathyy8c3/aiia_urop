Here is some code for linear search that uses the fact that a set of elements is sorted in increasing order: 

def search(L, e):
    for i in range(len(L)):
        if L[i] == e:
            return True
        if L[i] > e:
            return False
    return False


Consider the following code, which is an alternative version of 
search

def search1(L, e):
    for i in L:
        if i == e:
            return True
        if i > e:
            return False
    return False


Which of the following statements is correct? You may assume that each function is tested with a list

Explanation:

	    It is equally valid to iterate over the indicies of a list (as in 
search
search1
for
L = [4, 9, 2]
for i in range(len(L)):
is 
actually
for i in range(3): 
which is 
actually
for i in [0, 1, 2]: 
So iterating over the indicies of a list (as in 
search
for i in L: 
is 
actually
for i in [4, 9, 2]: 
Both methods of iteration are equally valid. At the end of the day, you should iterate in a way
	  that makes sense to you.

What is the difference between an Algorithm and a Program? 

          

            

              

                

                  
 An algorithm is a conceptual idea, a program is a concrete instantiation of an algorithm.

                

                  
An algorithm is limited to mathematical operation, a program can specify all kinds of operations. 

                

                  
An algorithm makes a slow program run fast. 

                

                  
 An algorithm deals with computer hardware, a program deals with computer software.

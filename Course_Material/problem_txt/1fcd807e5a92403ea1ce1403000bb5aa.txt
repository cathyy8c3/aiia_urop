Consider the following function definition: 

def foo(x, a):
   """
   x: a positive integer argument
   a: a positive integer argument

   returns an integer
   """
   count = 0
   while x >= a:
      count += 1
      x = x - a
   return count


      Please select the best glass box test suite for the function 
foo

      

        

          

            

              
 Test Suite A:
	      
foo(2, 5)
foo(5, 6)
foo(9, 7)

            

              
 Test Suite B:
	      
foo(10, 3)
foo(1, 4)
foo(10, 6)

            

              
 Test Suite C:
	      
foo(100, 5)
foo(96, 5)
foo(22, 5)

      

        

          

            
Explanation:
In glass box testing, we try to sample as many paths through the code as we can. 
	    In the case of loops, we want to sample three general cases:

            
Not executing the loop at all. 
Executing the loop exactly once. 
Executing the loop multiple times.
Test Suite B has cases that explores all three loop cases.
Test Suite A only explores paths that execute the loop 0 or 1 times.
Test Suite C only explores paths that execute the loop more than 1 time.

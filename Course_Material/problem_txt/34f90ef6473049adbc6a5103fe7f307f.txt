With a dict:  |    With a myDict:

                                          your choice of implementation

d[1] = 2           md.assign(1,2)       # use assign method to add a key,value pair

print(d[1])        print(md.getval(1))  # use getval method to get value stored for key 1

del(d[1])          md.delete(1)         # use delete method to remove 
                                          key,value pair associated with key 1

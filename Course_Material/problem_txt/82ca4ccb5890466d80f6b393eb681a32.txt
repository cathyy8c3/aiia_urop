        to calculate the score for a single word. The function
        
getWordScore

Scoring

            

              

                
The score for the hand is the sum of the scores
            for each word formed.

                
The score for a word is the sum of the points
            for letters in the word, multiplied by the length
            of the word, plus 50 points if all 
n

                
Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1,
            B is worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is
            worth 1, and so on. We have defined the dictionary
            
SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES

                
For example, 'weed' would be worth
            32 points ((4+1+1+2) for the four letters, then multiply by 
len('weed')

                
As another example, if

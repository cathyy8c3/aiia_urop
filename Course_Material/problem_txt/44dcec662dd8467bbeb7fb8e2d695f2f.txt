def applyF_filterG(L, f, g):
    """
    Assumes L is a list of integers
    Assume functions f and g are defined for you. 
    f takes in an integer, applies a function, returns another integer 
    g takes in an integer, applies a Boolean function, 
        returns either True or False
    Mutates L such that, for each element i originally in L, L contains  
        i if g(f(i)) returns True, and no other elements
    Returns the largest element in the mutated L or -1 if the list is empty
    """
    # Your code here
For example, the following functions, 
f
g
def f(i):
    return i + 2
def g(i):
    return i > 5

L = [0, -10, 5, 6, -4]
print(applyF_filterG(L, f, g))
print(L)
Should print:
6
[5, 6]

      For this question, you will 
not be able to see the test cases we run

    

      
# Paste your function here

Consider the following code specification: 

def union(set1, set2):
   """
   set1 and set2 are collections of objects, each of which might be empty.
   Each set has no duplicates within itself, but there may be objects that
   are in both sets. Objects are assumed to be of the same type.

   This function returns one set containing all elements from
   both input sets, but with no duplicates.
   """


Indicate which of the conditions below would combine to make a good black box test suite for the function 
union

      

        

          

            

              
set1
set2

            

              
set1
set2

            

              
set1
set2

            

              
set1
set2

            

              
set1

Explanation:
A good black box test suite would contain tests for all of the given 
	    conditions! Black-box testing tests the functionality of an application,
	    by looking at the paths through its specifications.
According to the specifications, the possibilities for

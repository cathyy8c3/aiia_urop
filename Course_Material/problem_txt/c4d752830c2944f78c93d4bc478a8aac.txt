Hints about the output

          
Be sure to inspect the above sample output carefully - very little is actually printed out 
	in this function specifically. Most of the printed output actually comes from the code you wrote
	in 
playHand
playHand
You should also make calls to the 
dealHand
Here is the above output, with the output from 
playHand

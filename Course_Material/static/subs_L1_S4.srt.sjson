    "So now that we've had the idea of creating", 
    "a recipe as a generic idea.", 
    "We know a little bit about what's inside the machine.", 
    "What we need to do is put those two things together.", 
    "We want to now go from a description", 
    "of a process to a specific set of statements", 
    "that we can store in the machine so", 
    "that that interpreter, that evaluator,", 
    "can then run those operations to use", 
    "the primitives inside the machine to do the work for us.", 
    "As we said, the programming language", 
    "is going to provide us with a set of primitive operations.", 
    "And the next step is to start talking about how", 
    "do we put them together.", 
    "To do that, we use something that we call an expression.", 
    "And the expressions in a language", 
    "are simply more complex but legal combinations", 
    "of primitives that the programming language", 
    "will recognize.",

    "after all of this high level discussion,", 
    "of getting to the place where we're", 
    "going to begin to get the computer to do something.", 
    "One of the things we're going to talk about though", 
    "is that any legal expression in a programming", 
    "language, any computation, has associated with it a value.", 
    "That value is the meaning of the expression.", 
    "And that's going to be important, in part", 
    "because if we know we want to get", 
    "to a particular computation, we want", 
    "to understand how do we get to that value,", 
    "well how do we back out of that the sequence of steps,", 
    "the expressions that are going to compute it for us.", 
    "So let's look at how we put this together.", 
    "Every programming language could be thought of", 
    "as consisting of a set of primitives,", 
    "a means of combination, a way of putting those primitives", 
    "together to create new expressions,", 
    "and a means of abstraction, a way", 
    "of taking some complex expression", 
    "and treating it as it's a primitive.", 
    "To talk about this in a programming language,", 
    "I'm going to give you an analogy to a natural language", 
    "like English.", 
    "In English, what are the primitive constructs?", 
    "They're words, lots of them, some of them", 
    "more common than others.", 
    "In a programming language, we also have primitive constructs.", 
    "These are the atoms on which we're going to build things.", 
    "And in a programming language those", 
    "are typically numbers, strings, or just sequences", 
    "of characters, and simple operations, the things that", 
    "were provided to us by the manufacturer-- addition,", 
    "subtraction, comparison.", 
    "Given those primitives, we want to put them together.", 
    "When we put them together, we have", 
    "to think about two different parts.", 
    "This is taking you back to an English class,", 
    "because we have both the syntax and the semantics.", 
    "The syntax is that parsing of a sentence to know,", 
    "is this a legal sentence or not.", 
    "And some combinations of expressions are legal.", 
    "Some are not.", 
    "For example an English, cat dog or boy", 
    "is not syntactically valid.", 
    "It does not make sense.", 
    "There is no verb in there.", 
    "On the other hand, cat hugs boy is syntactically valid.", 
    "It is a noun, a verb, a noun.", 
    "That's something that makes sense.", 
    "The same thing's going to happen in programming languages.", 
    "Some combinations of primitives are not legal.", 
    "They're not syntactically valid.", 
    "For example this expression right", 
    "here, the first part-- we're going", 
    "to come to this in a second-- is a string.", 
    "It's a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes", 
    "followed by a number.", 
    "It's not a legal expression.", 
    "On the other hand, as we'll see in a second,", 
    "this is a syntactically valid expression.", 
    "It consists of a number, an operator, and a number.", 
    "So we're going to talk about how do we", 
    "put together legal expressions.", 
    "What is the syntax of those, both", 
    "in terms of simple combinations like this and how", 
    "we do it when we get to more complex aspects", 
    "of the language?", 
    "Associated with every expression that is syntactically valid", 
    "is potentially a meaning, the semantics.", 
    "What does this expression evaluate to?", 
    "And here we're going to separate out both static semantics", 
    "and full semantics.", 
    "Static semantics tells us which syntactically valid strings", 
    "actually have a meaning.", 
    "In English, in bad English, the sentence I are hungry", 
    "is not actually meaningful.", 
    "It's syntactically valid, meaning", 
    "it's put together properly.", 
    "It's in this case a pronoun, a verb, and then an adjective.", 
    "A perfectly legal combination, but semantically", 
    "it doesn't make sense.", 
    "Same thing happens in a programming language.", 
    "The first expression, 3.2 times 5, is syntactically valid.", 
    "The second one, 3 plus the string high,", 
    "is syntactically valid.", 
    "It is a primitive, an operator, and a primitive,", 
    "but semantically it doesn't make sense.", 
    "I can't add a number and a string together.", 
    "So we have to distinguish things that are not", 
    "statically semantically valid because they're not", 
    "going to be expressions we want to try and assign a meaning to.", 
    "Once we have both syntactically correct and static semantically", 
    "correct expressions, we want to then know", 
    "what's the meaning associated with them.", 
    "And I'm going to start building this up.", 
    "Semantics then is the meaning associated", 
    "with that syntactically correct string of symbols", 
    "with no semantic errors.",

    "In English, we can have a sentence", 
    "that's both statically semantically", 
    "correct and syntactically correct,", 
    "but can have multiple meanings.", 
    "Flying planes can be dangerous.",

    "they're dangerous?", 
    "There are multiple interpretations to it.", 
    "Or from an old joke, this reading lamp", 
    "hasn't uttered a word since I bought it,", 
    "obviously playing on the word reading", 
    "lamp in a different way-- different meanings associated", 
    "with it.", 
    "In a programming language, there's", 
    "both good news and bad news.", 
    "The good news is any syntactically correct", 
    "and static semantically correct expression in a programming", 
    "language will only have one meaning.", 
    "But the challenge is it might not", 
    "be the meaning you intended.", 
    "And that's where bugs are going to show up.",

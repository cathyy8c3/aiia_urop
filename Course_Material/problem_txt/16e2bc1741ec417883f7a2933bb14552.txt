      First, implement the function 
isWordGuessed
secretWord
lettersGuessed
True
secretWord
secretWord
lettersGuessed
False
Example Usage:
>>> secretWord = 'apple' 
>>> lettersGuessed = ['e', 'i', 'k', 'p', 'r', 's']
>>> print(isWordGuessed(secretWord, lettersGuessed))
False
For this function, you may assume that all the letters in 
secretWord
lettersGuessed

    

      

def isWordGuessed(secretWord, lettersGuessed):
    '''
    secretWord: string, the word the user is guessing
    lettersGuessed: list, what letters have been guessed so far
    returns: boolean, True if all the letters of secretWord are in lettersGuessed;
      False otherwise
    '''

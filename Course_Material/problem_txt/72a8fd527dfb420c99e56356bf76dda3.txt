Consider the following code specification: 

def size(aSet):
   """
   aSet is a collection of objects, which might be empty.
   Objects are assumed to be of the same type.
   """


Here is a set of possible test cases to include in a black box test suite. Indicate which of the following conditions would make a good black box test suite for the function 
size

Explanation:
A good black box test suite would contain tests for the following 
	    conditions: Empty set, Set of size 1, and Set of size greater than 1.
Black-box testing is a method of software testing that tests the 
	    functionality of an application. Recall from the lecture that a way 
	    to think about black-box testing is to look at both the paths through the 
	    specification and the possible boundary cases. In this example, the boundary 
	    cases all have to do with the size of 
aSet
aSet
The remaining conditions would not further test the functionality of the 
	    
size

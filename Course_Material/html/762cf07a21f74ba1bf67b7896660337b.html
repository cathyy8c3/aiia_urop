<p>In this problem set, you'll implement <em>two</em> versions of a wordgame!</p>
<p>Don't be intimidated by the length of this problem set. There is a lot of reading, but it can be done with a reasonable amount of thinking and coding. It'll be helpful if you start this problem set a few days before it is due!</p>
<p>Let's begin by describing the 6.00 wordgame: This game is a lot like Scrabble or Words With Friends, if you've played those. Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words out of their letters. Each <strong>valid</strong> word receives a score, based on the length of the word and the letters in that word.</p>
<p>The rules of the game are as follows:</p>
<dl><dt><strong>Dealing</strong></dt><dd>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A player is dealt a hand of <em>n</em> letters chosen at random (assume <em>n=7</em> for now).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The player arranges the hand into as many words as they want out of the letters, using each letter at most once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some letters may remain unused (these won't be scored).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</dd><dt><strong>Scoring</strong></dt><dd>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The score for the hand is the sum of the scores for each word formed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The score for a word is the sum of the points for letters in the word, multiplied by the length of the word, plus 50 points if all <em>n</em> letters are used on the first word created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on. We have defined the dictionary <code>SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES</code> that maps each lowercase letter to its Scrabble letter value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, 'weed' would be worth 32 points ((4+1+1+2) for the four letters, then multiply by <code>len('weed')</code> to get (4+1+1+2)*4 = 32). Be sure to check that the hand actually has 1 'w', 2 'e's, and 1 'd' before scoring the word!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As another example, if <em>n</em>=7 and you make the word 'waybill' on the first try, it would be worth 155 points (the base score for 'waybill' is (4+1+4+3+1+1+1)*7=105, plus an additional 50 point bonus for using all <em>n</em> letters).</p>
</li>
</ul>

    of an integer by using successive additions.

def Square(x):
    return SquareHelper(abs(x), abs(x))

def SquareHelper(n, x):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    return SquareHelper(n-1, x) + x

Not considering recursion depth limitations, what is wrong with this implementation of procedure 
Square

      

        

          

            
It is going to return a wrong value.

            
The term 
Square

            
Function names cannot start with a capital letter.

            
The function is never going to return anything.

            
Python has arbitrary precision arithmetic.

            
This function will not work for negative numbers.

            
The call 
SquareHelper(abs(x), abs(x))
abs(x)

            
Nothing is wrong; the code is fine as-is.

As we'll see in subsequent lectures, everything in Python is an 
object
object methods

A complete description of the methods available to string objects can be found in the 
Python library reference on string methods

In this exercise, we want you to get some experience in using methods as functions. The convention for object methods is to use the "dot" notation, so that if 
s
s.upper
s.upper()

>>> s = 'abc'
>>> s.capitalize
<built-in method capitalize of str object at 0x104c35878>
>>> s.capitalize()
'Abc'


For each of the expressions in this problem, specify its type and value. If it generates an error, select type 'NoneType' and put the word 'error' in the box for the value. If it would be a function, select type 'function' and put the word 'function' in the box for the value. 

Assume we've made the following assignments: 

> str1 = 'exterminate!' 
> str2 = 'number one - the larch'


Assume that the expressions are evaluated in the order shown - that is, each problem part is evaluated directly after the previous problem part(s).

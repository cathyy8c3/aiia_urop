In this problem, you'll create a program that guesses a secret number!
The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). The 
      computer makes guesses, and you give it 
      input - is its guess too high or too low? Using bisection search, the computer will guess 
      the user's secret number!
Here is a transcript of an example session:
Please think of a number between 0 and 100!
Is your secret number 50?
Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. l
Is your secret number 75?
Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. l
Is your secret number 87?
Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. h
Is your secret number 81?
Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. l
Is your secret number 84?
Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. h
Is your secret number 82?
Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. l
Is your secret number 83?
Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. c
Game over. Your secret number was: 83

Hint: Endpoints

          
** Your program should use bisection search. So think carefully what that means.
              What will the first guess always be? How should you calculate subsequent guesses? 
** Your initial endpoints should be 0 and 100. Do not optimize your subsequent endpoints by making them be the halfway point plus or minus 1. Rather, just make them be the halfway point. 

        

          
Python Trick: Printing on the same line

          
Try the following in your console: 
              

# Notice how if we have two print statements                
print("Hi")
print("there")

# The output will have each string on a separate line:                
Hi
there
                
# Now try adding the following:
print("Hi",end='')
print("there")
print("Hi",end='*')
print("there")   
                
# The output will place the subsequent string on the same line
# and will connect the two prints with the character given by end
Hithere
Hi*there

Sorry, I did not understand your input.
Is your secret number 91?
Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. c
Game over. Your secret number was: 91
Note:
input
h
l
c
When the user enters something invalid, you should print out a message to the user explaining you 
    did not understand their input. Then, you should re-ask the question, and prompt again for input. For example:
Is your secret number 91?
Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. y
Sorry, I did not understand your input.
Is your secret number 91?
Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. c

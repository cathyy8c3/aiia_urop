<p style="font-size: 16px;">You are <strong>not allowed to look up or post answers to the questions, or to post on the discussion board anything regarding the exam</strong>. Any such posts will be immediately removed. </p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">This exam covers all material related to the Units 1, 2, 3.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>If you are having technical issues</strong>, please see if there is an answer in the <strong>"Common Grader Issues"</strong> page. Note that global variables will not work with our graders, sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">You may use as a resource anything we posted online (including the textbook), any other textbooks you may possess, and any notes you have prepared yourself. We ask you not to use the Internet to search for solutions. <strong>You may not communicate with any person about this examination.</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">For multiple choice problems you will be allowed exactly one submission; for coding questions you will be allowed 10 submissions, so that you may have a chance to fix any errors.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">Part of what we are testing on this exam is your ability to write comprehensive test suites for your own functions, which is why we limit the number of submissions allowed per coding problem. For problems that ask you to write your own code, you may use Anaconda or another IDE - or an online Python interpreter such as <a href="http://www.codeskulptor.org/" target="_blank">CodeSkulptor</a> or <a href="http://pythontutor.com/" target="_blank">Python Tutor</a> - to test your solution before pasting it into the answer box. We ask that you do not run code provided in non-coding questions in your IDE.</p>

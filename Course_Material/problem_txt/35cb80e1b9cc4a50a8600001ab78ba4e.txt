Here is some code for linear search that uses the fact that a set of 
elements is sorted in increasing order: 

def search(L, e):
    for i in range(len(L)):
        if L[i] == e:
            return True
        if L[i] > e:
            return False
    return False


Consider the following code, which is an alternative version of 
search

def search2(L, e):
    for i in L:
        if i == e:
            return True
        elif i > e:
            return False
    return False

Here is the code for selection sort. For simplicity, assume 
L
def selSort(L):
    for i in range(len(L) - 1):
        minIndx = i
        minVal = L[i]
        j = i+1
        while j < len(L):
            if minVal > L[j]:
                minIndx = j
                minVal = L[j]
            j += 1
        if minIndx != i:
            temp = L[i]
            L[i] = L[minIndx]
            L[minIndx] = temp

And here is a suggested alternative: 
def newSort(L):
    for i in range(len(L) - 1):
        j=i+1
        while j < len(L):
            if L[i] > L[j]:
                temp = L[i]
                L[i] = L[j]
                L[j] = temp
            j += 1

      

        
Do these two functions result in the same sorted lists? 

          

            

              

                

                  
 Yes

                

                  
 No

          

            

              

                
Explanation:
Yes, both 
selSort
newSort
selSort
You can sort a list by always moving the smallest element from the unsorted list to a new list. 
	    That procedure would add the elements to the new list in increasing order, and when every element 
	    from the old list has been moved over, we end up with a new sorted list. This type of sorting 
	    algorithm is often called Selection Sort.

Do these two functions execute the same number of assignments of values into entries of the lists? 

          

            

              

                

                  
 Yes. They execute the same number of assignments.

                

                  
 No.

 No.

 No. Either function may use more inserts than the other.

Below are some short Python programs. For each program, answer the associated question. 

Try to answer the questions without running the code. Check your answers, then run the code for the ones you get wrong. 

This question is going to ask you what some simple loops print out. If you're asked what code like this prints: 
num = 5
if num > 2:
    print(num)
    num -= 1
print(num)

write what it prints out, separating what appears on a new line by a comma and a space. So the answer for the above code would be: 

      
5, 4

If a given loop will not terminate, write the phrase 'infinite loop' in the box. 

      

        

          

            
Note: Using the 'range' built-in function

The standard way of using the 
range
range
range(stop)
>>> range(5)
range(0,5)

However, we can call 
range
optional parameters
range(start, stop)
>>> range(2, 5)
range(2, 5)

To specify a step size, you must specify a start value - the call is 
range(start, stop, stepSize)
>>> range(2, 10, 2)
range(2, 10, 2)
Note that these parameters - start, stop, stepSize - are the same parameters that you can use when slicing a string:
>>> s = "Hello, world!"
>>> s[1:] # s[start:]
ello, world!
>>> s[1:10] # s[start:stop]
ello, wor
>>> s[1:10:3] # s[start:stop:stepSize]
eow
In this problem you'll get more practice on using 
range
see more examples of 'range' here

      

        
num = 10
for num in range(5):
    print(num)
print(num)

          

            

        
divisor = 2
for num in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(num/divisor) 

          

            

        
for variable in range(20):
    if variable % 4 == 0:
        print(variable)
    if variable % 16 == 0:
        print('Foo!') 

          

            

        
for letter in 'hola':
    print(letter)  

          

            

        
count = 0
for letter in 'Snow!':
    print('Letter # ' + str(count) + ' is ' + str(letter))
    count += 1
    break
print(count)

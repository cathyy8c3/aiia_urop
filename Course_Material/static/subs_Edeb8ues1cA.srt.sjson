    "So here's the rough idea, and then we'll implement it.", 
    "I'm going to pick an index in the list that divides the list", 
    "roughly in half.", 
    "If it's not of even length, they're going to be close.", 
    "So I'm going to pick a thing midway through,", 
    "and I'm going to ask, is that element at the midpoint", 
    "the thing I'm looking for.", 
    "If it is, I'm done.", 
    "Fantastic.", 
    "If not, I'm going to ask is the thing I'm", 
    "looking at bigger or smaller than the thing I'm looking for.", 
    "And depending on that answer, I'll", 
    "either throw away the right half or the left half of the list.", 
    "Because I know that I can only lie in one of those two", 
    "sublists.", 
    "And I'm going to then do the same subdivision.", 
    "This is something you've seen before.", 
    "It's a divide and conquer algorithm.", 
    "I'm breaking this up into smaller versions", 
    "of the problem, smaller lists, and in fact, I'm", 
    "reducing the size of the problem in half at each step.", 
    "And of course, the nice property is the answer", 
    "to the smaller version is still the answer", 
    "to the original problem.", 
    "Once I found it, I return true.", 
    "If I can't find it, I return false.", 
    "Let's look at what that says about the way we would actually", 
    "do the search.", 
    "So if I've got a list of some size,", 
    "I'm going to start off looking at the midpoint saying is it", 
    "there or not.", 
    "n elements in that first version.", 
    "If it isn't, let's assume that the thing I'm looking for", 
    "is smaller than that midpoint.", 
    "So then I look at only half the elements.", 
    "And then let's assume in this case", 
    "that the thing I'm looking for is", 
    "bigger than the midpoint of that sublist.", 
    "I'm going to look at n over 4 elements.", 
    "And I'm going to keep reducing the size of the problem", 
    "down by a factor of 2.", 
    "So after i steps, I've got n over 2 to the i elements.", 
    "And I'm done when I've only got one element left.", 
    "Either it's the thing I'm looking for or not.", 
    "So what do I know?", 
    "I know I'm going to finish looking through the list", 
    "when n over 2 to the i is just 1.", 
    "And by a little bit of math, that's when i is log n.", 
    "Wonderful.", 
    "This is logarithmic in complexity", 
    "where n is the length of the list.", 
    "The characteristic-- cutting down the size of the problem", 
    "by a constant factor at each stage.", 
    "Wonderful thing to have if we can get it.", 
    "So this is really nice.", 
    "It's says if I've got a sorted list,", 
    "I can do bisection search in log time.", 
    "How would I implement it?", 
    "I'll show you two examples and one", 
    "that has a different kind of cost than the other.", 
    "So here's the first version of it.", 
    "Again, I've got a list l.", 
    "I'm looking for a particular element.", 
    "The base case is if there's nothing in the list,", 
    "obviously it's not there.", 
    "If I've only got one element in the list,", 
    "I'd simply check to see is it the thing I'm looking for", 
    "and return that Boolean value.", 
    "If it is, it's true.", 
    "If it's not, it's false.", 
    "Otherwise, what I want to do is find the halfway point", 
    "by taking the length of the list and doing an integer", 
    "divide by 2, which is going to give me an int.", 
    "And then I'm simply going to say is", 
    "the thing at the halfway point bigger than the thing", 
    "I'm looking for.", 
    "And if it is, I'm going to search only 1/2 of the list.", 
    "And if it isn't, I'm going to search", 
    "a different half of the list.", 
    "So there's a nice recursive way of solving this problem.", 
    "But let's look at the complexity.", 
    "That's constant.", 
    "That's constant.", 
    "That's great.", 
    "That's constant-- also great.", 
    "But that's not constant, and neither is that.", 
    "And by that, I don't just mean there's a recursive call.", 
    "We know that complexity.", 
    "We know that's going to be logarithmic.", 
    "The reason it's not constant is right there.", 
    "I'm making a copy of the list.", 
    "It's only half the list.", 
    "But if you think about it, I'm making", 
    "a copy of half the list in either case.", 
    "And in the next recursive call, I'm", 
    "going to make a copy of that half of the list,", 
    "but that's going to add up to a larger complexity,", 
    "and in fact, a complexity that is bigger", 
    "than I want because of that cost of actually copying the list.", 
    "What's an alternative?", 
    "A very nice alternative is to say keep the list,", 
    "but just keep track of where I'm looking at.", 
    "So here I'm going to set up right here a little helper", 
    "function.", 
    "But it's going to have two arguments-- the lower", 
    "half of the list I'm searching and the higher half of the list", 
    "I'm searching.", 
    "And what I'm going to simply do is change", 
    "where those pointers go to.", 
    "So let's look at it.", 
    "Again, the base case down here is", 
    "if I've got nothing in the list, the answer is clearly false.", 
    "Otherwise, I'm going to call this helper function", 
    "with the low pointer at the beginning", 
    "of the list and the high pointer at the upper end of the list.", 
    "And what does this now say?", 
    "It says if the two pointers are at the same place,", 
    "there's only one element there.", 
    "I just check to see if it's the thing I'm looking for.", 
    "Otherwise, I find the midpoint.", 
    "We're taking the average of those two things.", 
    "Ah.", 
    "That's right.", 
    "It says that's going to be halfway between low and high.", 
    "If, at the midpoint, I have the thing I'm looking for,", 
    "I return true.", 
    "Otherwise, if the thing at the midpoint", 
    "is bigger than what I'm looking for,", 
    "then if there's nothing left to search, I just return false.", 
    "Otherwise, I call it again with the same low point,", 
    "but now my high point is reduced to the midpoint.", 
    "I've thrown away half the things.", 
    "And in the other case, I change my low point", 
    "to keep the same high point.", 
    "So if I were to think about it, it's", 
    "as if I got my big list here.", 
    "I start off with low pointing there and high pointing here.", 
    "And after one recursive call, I might", 
    "have low pointing there and high still pointing here.", 
    "And after another recursive call,", 
    "I might have high pointing there and low pointing there.", 
    "But I'm cutting down half the search,", 
    "but not copying the list.", 
    "I'm just changing some numbers.", 
    "So now if we look at the complexity here,", 
    "that's not constant because of the recursive call.", 
    "But within it, it is a constant amount of work,", 
    "and the same thing there.", 
    "So the only things I'm counting now", 
    "are how many times do I do the recursive call,", 
    "but the call itself does a constant amount of work.", 
    "As a consequence, I've got now two algorithms.", 
    "The first one has login calls.", 
    "But within each of them, I have to make a copy of the list,", 
    "and that's a cost of n.", 
    "So overall, it's n log n.", 
    "I could make it slightly tighter,", 
    "but it's still going to be linear because of that copying", 
    "effort.", 
    "On the other hand, the second implementation", 
    "simply uses the indices as the parameters.", 
    "The list is never copied.", 
    "And so the only cost here is, in fact, the recursive call.", 
    "And that's really nice.", 
    "Just to give you a sense of this,", 
    "I've got those two implementations over here", 
    "in my code.", 
    "I'm going to run them into the machine,", 
    "and I'm just going to show you that they, in fact, compute", 
    "the same thing by calling bisection search.", 
    "", 
    "And I'm going to do the first version on a test list.", 
    "And I'm going to ask if the number 9 is there,", 
    "and it returns true.", 
    "And I could call the same thing, but ask", 
    "if the number 15 is there.", 
    "And it returns false.", 
    "And I can do bisection search with the more efficient", 
    "version.", 
    "Again, I'm going to call it with 9, and it returns true.", 
    "And if I call it with 15, it also returns false.", 
    "And it's really hard to see in the machine", 
    "the difference in timing, because it's a very small list.", 
    "But a complexity analysis tells us", 
    "that the second solution is going", 
    "to be much better than the first solution.", 
    "So what do we have here?", 
    "I want to search a sorted list where the size of the problem", 
    "I'm going to call and the length of the list.", 
    "Using linear search, order in.", 
    "Using binary search, I can search for the element", 
    "in order log n, which is great.", 
    "But I had to assume that the list was sorted.", 
    "So what does that say about the cost?", 
    "Well, does it make sense to first sort", 
    "the list and then search if I'm given", 
    "a list in arbitrary order?", 
    "So what that says is, well, I want", 
    "to know when is it better to do sort and search rather", 
    "than just search.", 
    "And that basically says, well, when", 
    "is the cost of sorting less than order and minus order log n.", 
    "And that's when the cost of sorting is less than order n.", 
    "And oh, darn.", 
    "That's never true.", 
    "Did I just waste your time?", 
    "Of course not.", 
    "Because if I'm only going to do it once,", 
    "it's probably not worth doing the sort and then the search.", 
    "I might as well just do a linear search.", 
    "I can amortize the cost.", 
    "And in particular, why would I bother sorting?", 
    "Well, in many cases, I might simply", 
    "want to sort the list once, but then do multiple searches.", 
    "I'm looking for different elements inside of this list.", 
    "I just did it with my little example on my machine.", 
    "And so I can amortize the cost of the sort over many searches.", 
    "If I'm going to do k searches, I then", 
    "want to know when is the cost of sorting plus k searches-- so k", 
    "times log n-- when is that less than just doing", 
    "k linear searches?", 
    "And for large k, that sort time becomes irrelevant,", 
    "because it's always going to be the case that that log cost is", 
    "much better than the linear cost.", 
    "So it is still important to sort and then search.", 
    "And that says we now need to look", 
    "at how do we do the sorting."

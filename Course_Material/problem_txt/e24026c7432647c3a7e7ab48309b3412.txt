In this problem, you'll be asked to read through an object-oriented implementation
      of the hand from the word game problem of Problem Set 4. You'll then be asked to implement one of
      its methods. Note that the implementation of the object-oriented version of the hand is a bit
      different than how we did things with the functional implementation; pay close attention to 
      doc strings and read through the implementation carefully.
To begin: Download 
hand.py

When you have completed reading through the file, implement the

Paste the entire
